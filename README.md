# HTLivesight

Welcome to the HTLiveSight Project.
With HTLiveSight, you can view your matches in a new way: you have explanations near the actions, live league table, popups and sound to notify you that something is happening in matches, even if you're doing other things on your PC or Android device!

You can also add friends, so their matches are automatically added when you launch the program!

This application is a browser extension and doesn't need any installation: the only requirement is have Mozilla Firefox for PC or Android, Google Chrome, Opera or Vivaldi installed! So it's compatible with all the operating systems!

Our aim is to use this space for GIT, while the downloads are hosted on Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons.
